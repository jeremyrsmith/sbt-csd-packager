# sbt-csd-packager

Sbt-csd-packager is an SBT plugin for packaging Custom Service Descriptors for Cloudera Manager.

The eventual goal of sbt-csd-packager is to be able to generate most, if not all, of the CSD from the source of the
application.  But currently, it is much more limited.  You can create the CSD by hand, and sbt-csd-packager will perform
some (limited) validation of your `service.sdl`.  Read the [CSD documentation](https://github.com/cloudera/cm_ext/wiki/CSD-Overview)
to get started.  Alternatively, you can define `service.sdl` using SBT settings and the provided ADT.

The current value of sbt-csd-packager comes mostly from the ability to deploy CSD artifacts using `publish`. This is
useful for not only publishing CSDs that include Scala programs, but also for creating SDLC around CSDs that don't
necessarily contain Scala programs or other executables (besides shell scripts or other scripts).

## Usage

To include the plugin, add the following to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("io.github.jeremyrsmith" % "sbt-csd-packager" % "0.1.2")
```

### Creating a CSD

1. Create a directory `src/main/csd`
2. Create a directory `src/main/csd/scripts` and add your CSD scripts
3. Define your `service.sdl`:
   1. To create the `service.sdl` by hand:
      1. Create a directory `src/main/csd/descriptor`
      2. Create the file `service.sdl` in that directory and define the service
   2. To create the `service.sdl` using SBT settings:
      1. Set `csdGenerateSdl := true` in `build.sbt`
      2. Use settings described under [SBT Settings](#sbt-settings) to build the service descriptor.  It will be written out to
         `service.sdl` when the `csd` task is run.

#### Adding other artifacts

Typically, you'll want to include your main build artifact in your CSD so that it can be executed by your driver scripts.
By default, the main build artifact is included in the `scripts` directory of the CSD.  If you want to add other files
to that directory, or include a different artifact, you can override the `csdAddScripts` task to control which files
and/or artifacts to include.

For example, if I'm using the `[sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly)` plugin, and I want to include the
assembled JAR instead of the main build artifact:

```scala
csdAddScripts := Seq((assembly in Compile).value -> (assembly in Compile).value.name)
```

This will cause:
1. The `csd` task to depend on the `assembly` task
2. The assembly JAR to be included (in the `scripts/` directory) using its original filename.

You might want to override the filename of the included artifact - for example, so you can refer to it with a stable
filename in your driver scripts.  `csdAddScripts` returns a sequence of tuples `(File, String)` - the File will be
included in the `scripts` directory with the String filename.  For example:

```scala
csdAddScripts := Seq((assembly in Compile).value -> "my-service.jar")
```

This will include the assembly JAR under `scripts/` with the stable filename `my-service.jar`.

### Publising a CSD

The `publish` task will automatically include the `csd` task.  The artifact generated by `csd` will be published along
with the other artifacts of your build.  The CSD artifact will have the `csd` classifier.

## SBT Settings

### Base Settings

The following settings are available directly in `build.sbt`.  They control things about the CSD itself:

#### `csdAddScripts : Seq[(File, String)]`

This is actually a Task rather than a Setting, so that it can depend on other tasks (like `package` or `assembly`).
Each `File` key referenced will be added to the `scripts/` directory of the CSD using the `String` value as its filename.

Default: Include the artifact created by `package` with its original filename.

#### `csdRoot : File`

The base directory for the CSD source.  This can be overridden to use a different directory from the default.

Default: `(sourceDirectory in Compile).value / "csd"` (typically `src/main/csd`)

#### `csdClassifier : String`

The classifier that will be attached to the CSD artifact upon publishing

Default: `csd`

#### `csdGenerateSdl : Boolean`

Whether to generate a `service.sdl` from SBT settings rather than using an existing `descriptor/service.sdl` file in
the `csdRoot`. See the following section for more details.

Default: `false`

### SDL Generation Settings

These settings are included under the `csdSettings` namespace.  To use them, you can either prefix them with
`csdSettings.`, or import them with `import csdSettings._`.  Many of these settings use the ADT from
[csd-base](https://github.com/jeremyrsmith/csd-base); see that project for documentation.

#### `csdName : String`

The name of the service.

Default: The `name` of the build

#### `csdVersion : String`

The version of the service.

Default: The `version` of the build

#### `csdDescription : String`

A description of the service.

Default: The `description` of the build

#### `runAs : csdbase.UserGroup`

The user and group that the service will run as.

Default: `UserGroup(user = "nobody", group = "nobody")`

#### `serviceInit : Option[csdbase.ServiceInit]`

Service commands to run when the service is initialized.

Default: `None``

#### `inExpressWizard : Boolean`

Whether the service should show up in Cloudera Manager's Express Wizard

Default: `false`

#### `maxInstances : Option[Int]`

The maximum number of instances of the service in a cluster

Default: `None`

#### `icon : Option[String]`

The path (relative to the CSD) of an icon to use for the service in Cloudera Manager.  If specified, it should be a
16x16 PNG.  If not specified, a default icon is used.

Default: `None`

#### `compatibility: Option[csdbase.Compatibility]`

Specifier for compatibility with other versions of the service, as well as with CDH.

Default: `None`

#### TODO

There are several other settings to be described.  Take a look at `Plugin.scala` to see the rest.
